Moreover, it keeps State legislative and executive officials informed of federal relations and the impact of proposals for change. In addition, the Committee serves also as a forum for considering certain State-local issues.\n \n To advance cooperation between the State and other units of government, the Committee proposes enactment of uniform or reciprocal laws; and adoption of compacts and uniform or reciprocal administrative rules. The Committee also endorses cooperation of governmental agencies, and the exchange and clearance of research and information.\n \n By law, the Committee has sixteen members. Eight are senators appointed by the Senate President and eight are delegates appointed by the House Speaker. The Senate President and House Speaker name the chair and vice-chair (Code State Government Article, secs. 2-901 through 2-906)."},{"Name":"William G.
